# COCT Fire and Rescue correspondance

## 2017-09-13 9am

Received a call from Fiona that Ludwig from COCT Fire and rescue was coming to perform an inspection. This was arranged by Richard and the trustees not informed. I had to leave work to attend to this. We went into the roof where Richard was requesting some sort of ruling from Ludwig that bitumin was dangerous compared to other options. Issues were noted

Responded to Ludwig noting the issues he had picked up. I had already addressed 2 issues that afternoon, 2 were already being addressed. I communicated when I would be able to address the rest.
